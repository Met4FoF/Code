    "# Noise-Jitter Removal Agent – Remove noise and jitter from signals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we generate a sine wave with a specified jitter which is supplied to an agent that adds noise to it in the form of a Gaussian distributed random variable. The noisy signal is then supplied to an agent that implements a noise and jitter removal algorithm to it. The outputs of both agents are supplied to separate monitor agents for visualization. The algorithm uses a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters describing the levels of jitter and noise in the measured signal and the parameters of a model for the underlying ‘true’ signal. The parameters are then used to provide estimates of the values of the true signal. Since the Bayesian posterior distribution does not take a standard form, inferences about the parameters are made based on a sample derived from the posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A detailed description of the algorithm and the involved methods can be found [here](https://github.com/Met4FoF/npl-jitter-noise-removal-mcmc#bayesian-noise-and-jitter-removal-algorithm--mcmcnj). \n",
