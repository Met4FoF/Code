# PyDynamic tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials and examples to document, explain and illustrate the possibilities offered by the parent library [_PyDynamic_](https://github.com/PTB-PSt1/PyDynamic). We will add more and more examples over time, especially those that are currently included in PyDynamic itself.

## Documentation

The detailed documentation of PyDynamic's source code is available on
[pydynamic.readthedocs.io](https://pydynamic.readthedocs.io/) and is enriched with
extensively commented calls of the PyDynamic methods in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
