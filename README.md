This repository combines all the code written for or used in the EMPIR project 17IND12 *Metrology for the Factory of the Future* to enable pulling/cloning all the code and all coding related documents at once.

## Installing Git

The following commands assume you already have Git installed. In case you do not have Git installed go to [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instructions for your operating system. After successful installation open Git Bash in Windows or the command line and run the given commands.

## Getting the code

To clone the repository locally, you go to any folder on your machine (i.e. `~/your/local/folder/`) and execute

```$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Met4FoF/Code Met4FoF_Code```

where `Met4FoF_Code` in the command stands for the folder you want the repository to go into. This folder does not need to exist before you execute the command. It will be created as a subfolder and your local repository will be created inside of that subfolder. If you do not specify a folder, the repository will be cloned to the subfolder `Code`, which is the repository's name.

## Updating the code

Whenever you want to get the latest changes, navigate into your local repository folder (i.e. `~/your/local/folder/Met4FoF_Code`) and execute

```$ git submodule update --remote```.

If you have not locally changed any of the files in the folders you will simply update all your local copies and get the latest version of all files on [github.com/Met4FoF/Code](https://github.com/Met4FoF/Code).

## Working on the code

Working on existing submodules' code is just the same as on a base respository. You switch to the submodule's folder inside your repository

```$ cd ~/your/local/folder/Met4FoF_Code/submodule_folder```

and start editing, committing and pushing in the submodule as if you were in a separate Git respository. Of course pushing to a remote repository at GitHub requires the according access rights for the submodule's repository. More on this topic you can find in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## Coming soon
