# ZeMA Testbed Bayesian Machine Learning

This is supported by European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR)
under the project Metrology for the Factory of the Future (Met4FoF), project number 
17IND12. (https://www.ptb.de/empir2018/met4fof/home/)

## Purpose

This is an implementation of Bayesian machine learning for the [ZEMA dataset ![DOI
](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1326278.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1326278)
on condition monitoring of a hydraulic system.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is navigating to the folder
in which you want to create a virtual Python environment (*venv*), create one,
activate it, install all necessary dependencies from PyPI.org and then
call _main.py_ with preset parameters. To do this, issue the
following commands on your Shell:

```shell
$ cd /LOCAL/PATH/TO/ENVS
$ python3 -m venv ZeMA_Testbed_Bayesian_Machine_Learning_venv
$ source ZeMA_Testbed_Bayesian_Machine_Learning_venv/bin/activate
(ZeMA_Testbed_Bayesian_Machine_Learning_venv) $ pip install -r requirements
.txt
Collecting [..]

(ZeMA_Testbed_Bayesian_Machine_Learning_venv) $ PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH python ZeMA_testbed_Bayesian_machine_learning/main.py

```

Now you can watch the execution of the Bayesian inference.
