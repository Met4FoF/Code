    "Signals are represented mathematically as functions of one or more independent variables. The independent variable in the mathematical representation of a signal may be either continuous or discrete. Continuous time signals are defined along a continuum of times and thus are represented by a continuous independent variable. Continuous time signals are often referred to as analog signals. Discrete time signals are defined at discrete times and, the independent variable has discrete values; i.e. discrete time signals are represented as sequences of numbers. In practical setting, such sequences can often arise from periodic sampling of an analog signal. In this case, the numeric value of the *n*th number in the sequence is equal to the value of the analog signal $x_{a}(t)$, at time *nT*; i.e.:\n",

    "As with continuous time signals, discrete time signals my be represented in a number of different ways. For example, sinusoidal and complex exponential sequences play a particulary important role in representing discrete-time signals. This is because complex exponential sequences are eigenfunctions of linear time-invariant systems and the response to a sinusoidal input is sinusoidal with the same frequency as the input and with amplitude and phase determined by system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear time invariant systems (more about in [8]) can be described by their impulse response, and the response to any time-distributed signal is described by convolving the signal with the impulse response. Convolution is a commutative and associative operation, but it is also quite computationally and conceptually expensive. For discrete signals, with the development of efficient Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, almost always, it is faster to implement a convolution operation in the frequency domain than in the time domain.\n",

    "The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is the equivalent of the continuous Fourier Transform for signals known only at instants separated by sample times (i.e.a ﬁnite sequence of data). The DFT corresponds to samples, equally spaced in frequency of the Fourier transform of the signal. In addition to its theoretical importance as a Fourier representation of sequnces, the DFT plays cetral role in the implementation of a variety of digital signal processing algorithms. This is because efficient algorithms exist for the computation of the DFT. These efficient algorithms are called *Fast Fourier transform (FFT)   algorithms* [8]. In particular for dynamic metrology, where the involved quantities have time varying values, the DFT is considered an essential tool. It is employed, for instance, to assess the frequency content of a measured time series, design suitable digital filters or carry out input estimation.[7]"

    "The time taken to evaluate a DFT on a digital computer depends principally on the number of multiplications involved, since these are the slowest operations. With the DFT, this number is directly related to $N^2$ (matrix multiplication of a vector), where *N* is the length of the transform. For most problems, *N* is chosen to be at least 256 in order to get a reasonable approximation for the spectrum of the sequence under consideration – hence computational speed becomes a major consideration. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms rely on the fact that the standard DFT involves a lot of redundant calculations and reduces their number."
