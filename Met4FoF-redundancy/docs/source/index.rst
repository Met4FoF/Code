Met4FoF-redundancy: Analysis of redundant measurements
========================================================

Met4FoF-redundancy is a software package containing software tools that can be used to analyze measurement data which contain redundancy. The main part of the development has been performed at `VSL <https://www.vsl.nl/>`_ (Netherlands), with help of the partner institutes `NPL <https://www.npl.co.uk/>`_ (UK), `PTB <https://www.ptb.de/>`_ (Germany) and `UCAM <https://www.cam.ac.uk/>`_ (UK).

This software has been developed as part of the joint European Research Project `EMPIR 17IND12 Met4FoF "Metrology for the Factory of the Future" <https://www.met4fof.eu/>`_.

A scientific publication explaining the ideas behind this software can be found in [Kok01]_. Related work can be found in [Kok02]_.

The package is written in Python 3. The source code can be found at `GitHub <https://github.com/gertjan123/Met4FoF-redundancy>`_.
