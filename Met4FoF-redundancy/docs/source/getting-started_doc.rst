Getting started
===============

Please download the Python code on `GitHub <https://github.com/gertjan123/Met4FoF-redundancy>`_ and use the functions that may be useful for you.

Usage of the module :mod:`MFred` is relatively straightforward. Note that all top level functions have their own *test* functions illustrating their usage. Please refer to other sections in this documentation for more information.

Usage of the module :mod:`agentMFred` requires the agentMet4FoF framework and in particular the metrological agents. See this `Read the Docs page <https://agentmet4fof.readthedocs.io>`_ for information on how to install and use the agentMet4FoF framework.
