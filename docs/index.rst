MF-red - Analysis of redundant measurements
=======================================================

MF-red (Met4FoF-redundancy) is a software package containing software tools that may be useful to analyze measurement data in which some form of redundancy is present. The main part of the development has been performed at `VSL <https://www.vsl.nl/>`_ (Netherlands), with help of the partner institutes `NPL <https://www.npl.co.uk/>`_ (UK), `PTB <https://www.ptb.de/>`_ (Germany) and `UCAM <https://www.cam.ac.uk/>`_ (UK).

This software has been developed as part of the joint European Research Project `EMPIR 17IND12 Met4FoF "Metrology for the Factory of the Future" <https://www.met4fof.eu/>`_.

MF-red is written in Python 3.
