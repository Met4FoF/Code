# EMPIR project 17IND12 ***Met4FoF*** coding guidelines
These coding guidelines apply to all code and software written for the project
and will constantly be extended as the project evolves and more code is written.  

1.  A module/class header should provide information about authors, available
    functions and module-/class-parameters.

1.  A function header should provide information about authors, what and how it
    is done and in- and output parameters.

1.  Format of comments should be consistent throughout one repository.

1.  Presentation of inputs and outputs should be consistent throughout one
    repository.

1.  If there are references to external sources in documenting comments, those
    should be consistently spread all over the project.

1.  A function body should include a reasonable amount of commenting to provide
    a broad idea of what is happening at different points within the function.

1.  For input and output parameters that are vectors or matrices information on
    the dimensions should be provided.

1.  It is highly recommended that version number and release date be included in
    every release.

1.  There should be no TODO-statements in production code.
